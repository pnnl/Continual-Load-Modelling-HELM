**Continual Load Modelling (HELM)** provides an approach to the exisiting load modelling efforts by considering power electronic devices while formulating generalized 
load structures. Previously load models were defined as (1) conventional ZIP (constant impedance (Z), current (I), and power (P) at fundamental frequency. 
(2) Adjusted ZIP to account for the current harmonics using a multiplying factor, the voltage harmonics are not considered. (3) Norton Model utilizes a linear relationship 
between corresponding harmonic components of load current and voltage, the cross coupling effects between the current and voltage harmonics are not considered.
Frequency Coupling Matrix (FCM) approach allows a cross coupling between the load current and voltage through a linear relationship. It utilizes the generalized 
Norton model, cross admittance matrix, harmonic admittance matrix. The main drawback is that it assumes a linear relationship between the harmonics.
The non-linear coupling model provides a cross coupling between the load current and voltage using a non-linear relationship. The major challenge incorporates a 
generalized model with high throughput data.

```math
\begin{bmatrix}I_1\\I_2\\.\\.\\.\\I_n\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}f_1(V_1,V_3,...,V_{km})\\f_3(V_1,V_3,...,V_{km})\\...\\f_{km}(V_1,V_3,...,V_{km})\end{bmatrix}
```

For generation of synthetic throughput data we utilize PSCAD/EMTdc software for feederwide interactions between multiple houses with power electronic loads such as EV, laptop, desktop, PV inverter, HVAC.

Non-linear power electronic loads intothe distribution network has the potential to disrupt the existing distribution transformer operations. They were not designed to mediate the excessive heating losses 
generated from the harmonics. To have a good  understanding of  current standing challenges, a knowledge of the generation and load mix as well as the current harmonic estimations are essential for designing 
transformers and evaluating their performance.

Detailed power electronic models are developed for different load combinations to create harmonic rich datasets to entail their effect on transformer operation using PSCAD/EMTdc. A high fidelity dataset 
was curated for the analysis using a mixture of different power electronic load combinations including laptops, desktops/television, PV, HVAC and EVs. High fidelity data for two datasets are available
(i) 10 scenarios for 5 different houses connected to the secondary of a split phase transformer is provided, and (ii) 11 scenarios for 5 different houses with EV as an additional load.

Currents recorded in the transformer secondary for scenarios described were recorded. The load compositions depict different times of the day when the transformer would be loaded close to 
its maximum operating capacity.

Analysis of the transformer secondary currents are performed to have a detailed understanding on the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and Eddy Current losses (%).
